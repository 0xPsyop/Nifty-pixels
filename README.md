This is the Nifty-pixels NFT(ERC721) contract. 

It is a simple and fun NFT project that mints a random SVG pixel (on-chain generative NFT) that mints a random RGB color with a random tokenId by using a simple 
algo and current block variables to determine it. 

The supply cap is 10,000.

* It's pseudo random and not totally random as the blockchain can't produce totally random numbers
